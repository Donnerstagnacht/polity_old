1. Review passing of data from the logged in user between components and services? Can I establish best practices and make the uuid easier accissible (behavior subject?observable?)
2. Review the error handling of database request
3. Optimize search for users - search for users after key up and optimize index for not inprecise search strings/queries
4. Fill database with 2 test users - can t solve the issue that I can not add data to the auth table from my seed-/migration files
5. Add mitgration/setup description for new collaborators
6. How do transactions work exactly in postgres?
