1. Review passing of data from the logged in user between components and services? Can I establish best practices and make the uuid easier accissible (behavior subject?observable?)
2. Review the error handling of database request
3. Optimize search for users - search for users after key up and optimize index for not inprecise search strings/queries
4. Fill database with 2 test users - can t solve the issue that I can not add data to the auth table from my seed-/migration files
5. Add mitgration/setup description for new collaborators
6. How do transactions work exactly in postgres?
7. Should I query database with join in the database with database functions or on the client with supabase api and javascript?
8. Side and top navigation - second ng-template container? So that the main content can be added in the main section
9. Top navigation - active routs in groups display multiple pages active at the same time
10. Do we need all the try/catch statements on components? Can we move them to services? Do we need them at all or can we replace them by observables/promises with then/catch?
11. Check if user is already a group member in "confirmGroupRequests"
